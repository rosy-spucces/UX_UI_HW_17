<div>
  <p> I am an experienced Designer with a demonstrated history of working with top licenses and creating original artwork. 
    A Jack of all trades with broad skills in Typography, Packaging, Apparel Design, and Art Direction to name a 
    few. After 11 years of working in my field, I have been praised for my time management, artwork originality, and 
    technical skills.
    
    My background includes corporate, startup, and freelance graphic design experience, with a history of leading print, apparel, and digital design projects to completion. Most recently, I am enrolled in the UX-UI Bootcamp at Columbia University to sharpen my skills in design, research, and coding. I have designed products that have sold nationwide and worked with global brands and companies, including Viacom, Lenox, Warner Brothers, SONY, Colette Paris, Disney, KitchenAid, Live Nation, and Space X, as well as a host of startup and mid-size businesses.
